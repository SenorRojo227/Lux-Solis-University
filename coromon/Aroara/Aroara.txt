{Demo}

[Overview]
Aroara is one of the strongest wallbreakers in the Demo due to its high damage output and amazing coverage
options. It is capable of nuking the entire metagame with Glacier and Splash alone, leaving it with very few
reliable checks and virtually no counters. Additionally, it's Ice typing provides it with 4 resistances allowing
it to come in safely on Coromon such as Sheartooth and Slitherpin. Its main flaw stems from its lack of priority
leaving it succeptible to being revenge killed by Coromon such as Pitterbyte and Beezel.
